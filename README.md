# EBiM Benchmark Website — EBiM-Benchmark

**Toward a Globally Coordinated Benchmark for Real-World Embodied Bimanual Manipulation**

A globally coordinated benchmark for real-world embodied bimanual manipulation — Competition + Workshop, 2026

### Contact form: deep links & categories

`contact.html` posts to Web3Forms. **Deep links** — `contact.html?topic=SLUG` pre-selects a category. The accepted query slugs (below) are unchanged; each maps to the matching option's stable `data-slug`, and the visible dropdown label can differ:

- `register` → Competition — Register Interest
- `competition` → Competition Question
- `partner` → Partnership Inquiry *(label: "Partnership — Hardware, Funding & Compute")*
- `workshop` → Workshop / Poster Submission
- `media` → Media / Press
- `tech` → Technical (Platform / Website)
- `partnership` → Partnership / Testbed Hosting *(label: "Partnership — Testbed Hosting")*

Unknown/absent slug = no pre-selection.

**Adding a category** — everything keys off a stable per-option `data-slug` (so the human-readable `value`/label can change without touching routing). In `src/contact.njk`:

1. Add the `<option value="…" data-slug="SLUG">` to the category `<select>`.
2. Add a `SLUG → "[PREFIX] "` entry to the JS `prefixMap` (the email subject prefix).
3. *(optional)* add a query-slug → `data-slug` entry to the `?topic=` `topicMap`.
4. *(optional)* add the `data-slug` to the `DISCORD_TOPICS` array if the category should reveal the "faster path" Discord CTA (shown after the Category field).

The `data-slug` — not the option `value` — is the key shared across these places. The `value` string is the Web3Forms payload and is otherwise free to change.

**Destination email** is configured in the Web3Forms dashboard (tied to the access key in `src/contact.njk`), not in any committed file — so the address stays out of the public repo.

## Architecture overview

The site is a **multi-page** static site, built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) — Nunjucks templates in `src/` compile to static HTML in `_site/`. Three primary content pages, a contact form, and a 404:

| Page | URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Home** | `index.html` | Landing page that funnels visitors to one of two tracks — minimal deep content, maximal navigation clarity |
| **Competition** | `competition.html` | The EBiM Competition — benchmark tasks, Mobile FR3 Duo platform, cross-continent testbeds, CFP |
| **Workshop** | `workshop.html` | The EBiM Benchmark workshop program — schedule, invited talks, panel, posters, dissemination |
| **Contact** | `contact.html` | Categorized Web3Forms contact form (+ `contact-success.html` no-JS fallback, `contact-test.html` internal health check) |
| **404** | `404.html` | Branded not-found page (`noindex`) with shared chrome and CTAs back to the primary pages |

### Why the split

The home page used to contain everything — schedule, benchmark spec, platform photos, task cards, organizers, partners. As the project grew, the page became too long and visitors couldn't quickly find what they needed. The current architecture:

- **Home** acts as a landing/funnel page (Two Ways to Engage cards, Key Themes, EBiM Maturity Roadmap, Important Dates summary, Organizers, Partners).
- **Competition** owns benchmark/platform/task/testbed deep content.
- **Workshop** owns schedule/talks/panel/posters/dissemination deep content.
- The Three-Phase Mechanism diagram appears on Home and Competition (Phase III = the Workshop is referenced as a link). It is **distinct** from the home page's EBiM Maturity Roadmap (Alpha/Beta/Gamma), which describes the multi-year initiative across editions, not this year's phases.
- Organizers and Partners live only on Home and are linked from sub-pages.

```

Each `src/*.njk` page extends `_includes/layouts/base.njk` and supplies its own head meta
(OG/Twitter/JSON-LD), inline `<style>`, body, and (the contact pages) trailing `<script>`.
`permalink` front matter pins the exact `.html` URLs, so output paths are unchanged.

---

## Setup

Built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (a `package.json` dependency). Prettier is a dev dependency used only by the parity harness — there are no runtime dependencies in the shipped site.

```bash
npm ci            # install Eleventy (+ Prettier)
npm run build     # compile src/ → _site/
npm run serve     # local dev server with live reload (eleventy --serve)
```

### Parity harness

`node scripts/verify.mjs` (alias `npm run verify`) builds the site and asserts the English output is byte/semantically identical to the golden fixtures committed in `tests/baseline/` — markup structure (Prettier-normalized), HTML comments, JSON-LD (deep-equal, order-insensitive), and the contact-form internals. It runs on every PR via `.github/workflows/verify.yml`.

**Changing English output on purpose** means the baseline must be regenerated in the same commit — otherwise the net correctly goes red. Run `npm run build`, then copy the 7 `_site/*.html` into `tests/baseline/`.

`node scripts/verify-zh.mjs` (alias `npm run verify:zh`, or `npm run verify:all` to run both) checks the unpublished `/zh/` preview against the same build: each `/zh/` page is `<html lang="zh-Hans">`, carries `noindex`, has a self-referential `/zh/` canonical, emits no `hreflang`, links localized targets under `/zh/` (workshop/contact fall back to EN), and contains translated CJK text — and site-wide that `/zh/` is absent from `sitemap.xml` and no page emits `hreflang`. CI runs both harnesses on every PR.

### GitHub Pages deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds the site and deploys `_site/` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. This takes effect once the repo's Pages source is set to **GitHub Actions** (Settings → Pages → "Build and deployment" → Source).

---

## Internationalization (i18n)

English is the published locale. A **Simplified-Chinese `/zh/` preview** (the landing + competition pages) was added in **Phase 1b** but ships **unpublished** behind a single flag, so the English output is unchanged and the Chinese pages are invisible to search until the team approves them. Structured-data and shared-chrome strings are factored out so a locale is added without touching the EN templates:

- **`src/_data/event.json`** — language-neutral structured-data facts (dates, canonical URLs, organizer/sponsor lists, testbed addresses) shared by the index + competition JSON-LD.
- **`src/_data/i18n/<lang>.json`** — translatable strings, namespaced `brand` / `nav` / `footer` / `meta` (per-page head-meta) / `jsonld`. `en` is the fallback locale; `zh` (Simplified Chinese, machine draft) mirrors every `en` key — any key left untranslated falls back to English.
- **`src/_data/eleventyComputed.js`** — `t` resolves the page's `lang` (default `en`) with **English fallback**; `pageMeta` / `jsonLd` build the per-locale head-meta and index/competition JSON-LD. Locale-aware helpers keep the shared shell working under `/zh/` while leaving EN byte-identical: `htmlLang` (`en` → `zh-Hans`), `assetBase` (`""` → `"../"` since `/zh/` is one directory down), `links` (nav targets: index + competition relative under `/zh/`, the not-yet-localized workshop + contact resolve back up to EN), `zhNoindex`, and the gated `hreflangAlternates`.
- **`src/_includes/`** — `base.njk` / `head.njk` / `navbar.njk` / `footer.njk` read locale via those helpers; the EN render path is unchanged and guarded by the parity harness.
- **`src/zh/`** — the localized pages (`lang: zh` via `zh.11tydata.json`), reusing the same includes; only the body prose, `<html lang>`, canonical, and head-meta differ.

**Unpublished gate — `src/_data/site.json` → `"zhPublished": false`.** While false, every `/zh/` page emits `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`, `/zh/` is kept out of `sitemap.xml` (a passthrough file — never add it there), and **no `hreflang` is emitted anywhere** (EN or zh). Flipping `zhPublished` to `true` is the one-line publish: it drops the `noindex` and emits the `en` / `zh-Hans` / `x-default` hreflang cluster on the index + competition pair. `scripts/verify-zh.mjs` proves the unpublished state; note that publishing will change the EN `<head>` (adding hreflang), so the EN baseline must be regenerated in that same commit.

## Shared chrome (navbar + footer)

The navbar and footer are single Nunjucks includes — `src/_includes/navbar.njk` and `src/_includes/footer.njk` — pulled into every page by `src/_includes/layouts/base.njk`. There is one source of truth, so there is nothing to "keep in sync." `contact.njk` sets `navActive: contact` in its front matter, which adds `aria-current="page"` to the Contact nav link; no other page sets an active state.

> Earlier versions duplicated these blocks across all 7 HTML files and guarded them with `<!-- SHARED NAVBAR/FOOTER — keep in sync … -->` comments. The Eleventy migration replaced that with the includes above, and those scaffolding comments were dropped.

### Updating the shared chrome

Edit `src/_includes/navbar.njk` or `src/_includes/footer.njk` once (their visible labels come from `src/_data/i18n/en.json` via the `t` lookup). `npm run build` regenerates every page, and `node scripts/verify.mjs` confirms nothing else changed.

### Navbar items

- **EBiM Benchmark** brand → `index.html`
- **Home** dropdown → 5 sub-items linking to home sections (incl. Maturity Roadmap)
- **Competition** dropdown → 8 sub-items linking to competition sections
- **Workshop** dropdown → 7 sub-items linking to workshop sections
- **Organizers** → `index.html#organizers`
- **Partners** → `index.html#partners`
- **Contact** → https://ebim-benchmark.github.io/contact.html

### Footer columns

- **Pages**: Home / Competition / Workshop
- **People**: Organizers / Partners
- **Participate**: Compete / Submit Poster / Contact Us

---

## Active page indicator

Each page has a body class that drives the navbar's "you are here" highlight:

| Page | Body class |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | `<body class="page-home">` |
| `competition.html` | `<body class="page-competition">` |
| `workshop.html` | `<body class="page-workshop">` |
| `contact.html` | `<body class="page-contact">` |
| `404.html` | `<body class="page-404">` |

The CSS rule:

```css
.page-home          .nav-home > a,
.page-competition   .nav-competition > a,
.page-workshop      .nav-workshop > a {
  color: var(--accent);
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

For section-level highlighting (which dropdown sub-item or TOC item is currently in view), `js/main.js` adds an `.active` class on scroll, matching any link whose `href` ends with `#<section-id>`. This works for both bare anchors (`#why`) and cross-page hrefs (`competition.html#why`) used in the shared dropdowns.

---

## On-page TOC sidebar (sub-pages only)

`competition.html` and `workshop.html` include an `<aside class="toc-sidebar">` right after their sub-hero. CSS makes it fixed-position, right-side, 200px wide, and visible **only at viewports ≥ 1400px**. The home page and 404 page don't include the aside.

Behavior:
- Hidden by default (CSS `opacity: 0; visibility: hidden`).
- JS adds `.is-visible` once the user scrolls past the sub-hero (with a 100px buffer for a smoother handoff). Fade-in animates over 300ms.
- Default visible state is **55% opacity** so it doesn't compete with content; goes opaque on hover or keyboard focus-within.
- Active section gets a 2px cyan left rail + bold cyan text, driven by the same `markActive()` scroll handler that highlights navbar dropdown items.

---

## Mobile nav behavior

- **Breakpoint**: ≤ 768px shows hamburger; ≥ 769px shows the desktop horizontal navbar.
- **Drawer**: `position: fixed`, slides down from the top with `transform: translateY(calc(-100% - var(--nav-h) - 0.5rem))` in the closed state — this calc-based hide guarantees the drawer fully clears the navbar at any drawer height (a percentage-only translate broke when dropdowns collapsed and the drawer became shorter).
- **Scrollable**: `max-height: calc(100vh - var(--nav-h))` + `overflow-y: auto` so the drawer scrolls when content (especially with all dropdowns expanded) exceeds the viewport.
- **Collapsible dropdowns**: each parent dropdown `<li>` includes a separate `<button class="dropdown-toggle">` next to the link. The link still navigates when tapped; the button toggles a `.expanded` class on the `<li>` to show/hide the sub-menu. One open at a time. Closing the hamburger drawer collapses any expanded dropdown.

---

## Anchor-jump scroll offset

In-page navigation lands the user on a section two ways: the navbar dropdowns (Home / Competition / Workshop sub-items) and the TOC sidebar jump to `#section` anchors, and the contact deep-link (`contact.html?topic=…`) calls `scrollIntoView({ block: 'start' })` on `.contact-card`. Because the navbar is `position: fixed`, a raw jump aligns the target to the very top of the viewport, leaving it hidden under the navbar.

`html { scroll-padding-top: calc(var(--nav-h) + 1rem) }` lands those jumps just below the navbar instead. One rule covers both cases — `scroll-padding-top` is honored by native fragment navigation **and** by `scrollIntoView({ block: 'start' })` — and it tracks `--nav-h` automatically, clearing 68px desktop / 60px at the ≤ 380px breakpoint, plus a 1rem gap.

---

## SEO infrastructure

Each content page (`index`, `competition`, `workshop`) carries:

| Element | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Unique `<title>` (≤ 66 chars) | SERP truncation safe |
| Unique `<meta name="description">` (≤ 156 chars) | SERP truncation safe |
| Unique `<link rel="canonical">` | Avoid duplicate-content penalties |
| Unique OG (`og:url`, `og:title`, `og:description`) + Twitter Card tags | Per-page social previews |
| OG image (`og-cover.png`, 1200×630, ~87 KB) | Spec-compliant social card |
| `<meta name="keywords">` | Used by some academic indexers |
| `<meta name="google-site-verification">` | Search Console verification token |
| JSON-LD `Event` schema | Rich event card |
| JSON-LD `Organization` schema | Brand entity |
| JSON-LD `BreadcrumbList` (sub-pages) | Breadcrumb-style SERP enhancement |
| JSON-LD with `subEvent` array (workshop) | Each invited talk + the panel as discoverable sub-events |

`404.html` is intentionally `noindex` and has no OG tags.

`sitemap.xml` lists 4 URLs (home, competition, workshop, contact) and is referenced from `robots.txt`.

### Heading hierarchy

Each page has exactly **one `<h1>`**. Section headings are `<h2 class="section-title">`. Sub-section headings are `<h3>` (the previous `<h2>` → `<h4>` skips in theme/talk/dissemination cards have been fixed by promoting them to `<h3>`).

### Image attributes

Every `<img>` has `alt`, `width`, `height` (CLS prevention), `loading="lazy"`, and `decoding="async"`. The hero/sub-hero brand is a pure CSS/text wordmark (no image), so there is no hero LCP image; remaining LCP-critical images carry `fetchpriority="high"` and `loading="eager"`.

---

## Image asset strategy

### Open Graph image
- `img/og-cover.png` — 1200×630 PNG, ~87 KB, EBiM-branded (rasterized from `img/og-cover.svg`). Matches the social-share spec. The pre-rebrand `og-cover.jpg` was removed.

### Platform photos (competition.html only)
- WebP versions are the primary asset for ~96% of browsers (~18 KB and ~31 KB respectively).
- PNG versions stay as fallback for the ~4% of browsers without WebP support, served via `<picture>` element:

  ```html
  <picture>
    <source srcset="img/platform/MFR3_Duo.webp" type="image/webp">
    <img src="img/platform/MFR3_Duo.png" alt="..." width="1600" height="900" loading="lazy">
  </picture>
  ```
- Net page-weight savings: ~10.7 MB → ~49 KB combined for the two photos when WebP is served.

### Partner logos
- Arranged in ICRA-style tiers (Platinum · Gold · Silver · Bronze) with descending logo prominence; per-tier sizing lives in `css/style.css` under `/* ---------- Partners (ICRA-style tiered) ---------- */`, with a few per-logo overrides (e.g. Google shrunk, AMD nudged up via `transform: scale`, VRB/RIG/HHRI enlarged, Galbot shrunk).
- SVGs render at native resolution; for raster logos `width`/`height` attrs match the source-file dimensions for CLS prevention.
- All partner logos use `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`. (The folder stays `img/sponsors/` so asset paths remain stable.)

- [x] Franka Community: Community Resources callout on competition.html + footer link (the inline note under the Franka card was dropped in the tier redesign)
- [x] Discord integration: invite (`discord.gg/pGwRbMRjuH`) wired into the shared footer (all 7 pages), a category-conditional "faster path" CTA on `contact.html` (shown after the Category field for competition/register/workshop topics), and the competition Community pillar (Discord + GitHub linked; Docs + Cloud Access left bare pending public URLs)
- [x] 4-testbed coverage: Hamburg (top floor of the Google Hamburg office), Munich, Pittsburgh, Shanghai (Franka Robotics branch office)
- [x] Competition timeline: Simulation Release Jun 20 → Simulation End Aug 5 → Results Announced Aug 6 → Phase II two-window (team hands-on bench testing Aug 6–15; organizer-run testing & evaluation Aug 16–31, with code submission staying open — not a freeze); workshop date & Final Results TBD
- [x] Competition awards (per task): Real-World Excellence — 1st $1,500 / 2nd $1,000 / 3rd $500 cash, each + a Franka Robotics purchase voucher (US$3,750 / $2,500 / $1,250 value) + trophy/gift; Simulation Prize (AMD) $300 / $200 / $100; + in-kind AMD dev hardware (US/DE/Asia). PRIZE_HEADLINE "Up to $5,250 in prizes per task — cash + purchase voucher, trophy & gift" propagated to the home hero, Two-Ways badge, Competition hero + Awards intro, and SEO meta. The label always reads "cash + purchase voucher" (never implies $5,250 is pure cash).
- [x] Branding unified under EBiM Benchmark
- [x] OG cover image — EBiM-branded `og-cover.png` at 1200×630 spec (rasterized from `og-cover.svg`)
- [x] Panel: four confirmed panelists — Stefan Schaal (Intrinsic), Kenny Kimble (NIST), Sven Parusel (Franka Robotics), Shaowei Cui (SCUT); host TBA (mirrored across the schedule row, panel cards, and JSON-LD)
- [x] Google Search Console verified for `https://ebim-benchmark.github.io/`
- [x] SEO: per-page meta tags, JSON-LD (Event + Organization + BreadcrumbList), sitemap with 4 URLs, alt text + width/height on every img
- [x] Heading hierarchy fixed (no h2 → h4 skips)
- [x] Mobile nav: scrollable drawer + collapsible dropdowns
- [x] Sticky on-page TOC sidebar on sub-pages (≥1400px)
- [x] Image optimization: platform PNGs → WebP (~99.5% reduction); OG cover resized + reformatted
- [x] EBiM Maturity Roadmap (Alpha 2026 → Beta 2027 → Gamma, foreseeable future) strip on the home page, styled distinctly from the Phase I/II/III pipeline; links the PR2 Beta Program
- [x] Partner logos wired with links: vivo (Gold), Galbot, Lightwheel, ManipulationNet (Bronze) — files added under `img/sponsors/`

### Still needed
- [ ] Real headshots in `img/organizers/` (currently using initials avatars)
- [ ] Confirm workshop date & venue (decoupled from any fixed conference; currently TBD)
- [ ] Confirm Final Results date on index.html Important Dates (currently TBD)
- [ ] Confirm invited-talk speakers + titles and the panel host on workshop.html (currently TBA)
- [ ] Fill in workshop poster submission deadlines on workshop.html (currently TBD)
- [ ] Optional: convert remaining partner PNGs to WebP for marginal extra perf
